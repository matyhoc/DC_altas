Codes for Pan-cancer analyses refine the single-cell portrait of tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells
## 001_proportion_stacked_bar_plots.R
**Part 1:** Codes for boxplots showing the proportion of AS DC and LC-like subset divided by the total number of DCs in tumor tissues across various cancer types.

**Part 2:** Codes for Boxplots showing the fraction of AS DC, LAMP3+ DC and LC-like subset (divided by the total cell number of DCs) and cDC2_CXCL9, cDC2_C1QC, cDC2_ISG15 (divided by the total cell number of cDC2s) in tumor and adjacent normal tissues of several cancer types.
