## 001_proportion_stacked_bar_plots.R
**Part 1:** Codes for stacked bar plots showing the distribution of 10 DC subsets in tumor tissues of each cancer type.

**Part 2:** Codes for stacked bar plots showing the distribution of seven cDC2 subsets in tumor tissues of each cancer type.

**Part 3:** Codes for the tissue distribution pattern of all cells collected.

**Part 4:** Codes for stacked bar plots showing the distribution of major immune cell types across different cancer types.
## 002_subset_comparison_boxplots.R
**Part 1:** Codes for boxplots showing the proportion of AS DC and LC-like subset divided by the total number of DCs in tumor tissues across various cancer types.

**Part 2:** Codes for Boxplots showing the fraction of AS DC, LAMP3+ DC and LC-like subset (divided by the total cell number of DCs) and cDC2_CXCL9, cDC2_C1QC, cDC2_ISG15 (divided by the total cell number of cDC2s) in tumor and adjacent normal tissues of several cancer types.
## 003_ROGUE.R
